# Vert.x-Mars

Vertx-Mars provides libraries to get you easier up and running with Vert.x for mostly REST-based web applications.
Vert.x provides you a modular toolkit for building microservices from the core of your code to your infrastructure.

These libraries will provide you some easier API's for calling a data stores like MySQL and Redis. But also provide an 
easy layer of HTTP related tools and methods to make your code a bit more simple.

This library is mainly created for my personal use so I can reuse these libraries which are normally in my projects code.
Now I have the ability to have version control and ship it to all the Vert.x projects I am working on.
